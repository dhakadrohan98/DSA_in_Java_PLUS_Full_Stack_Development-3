# Java Full Stack E-commerce Project

Welcome to my Java Full Stack E-commerce Project repository! ðŸš€ This collection of projects represents my journey in learning and implementing various Java technologies for building robust and scalable E-commerce websites. Here, I've applied concepts such as Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL database.

   - Dependency injection and inversion of control.

### 2. Spring MVC
   - Building a web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
   - Handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 3. Spring JDBC
   - Integrating Spring with JDBC for efficient database operations.
   - Executing SQL queries and handling transactions.

### 4. Spring ORM
   - Integrating Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool.
   - Mapping Java objects to database tables.

### 5. Spring Boot
   - Rapid development of Spring applications with minimal configuration.
   - Auto-configuration and convention over configuration.

### 6. Hibernate
   - Deep dive into Hibernate for managing database interactions.
   - Configuring and utilizing Hibernate in a Spring application.

### 7. Spring Data JPA
   - Simplifying data access using Java Persistence API (JPA) with Spring Data.
   - Repository pattern for database operations.

### 8. MySQL Database Concepts
   - Understanding database concepts such as tables, relationships, and normalization.
   - Implementing MySQL as the backend database for E-commerce projects.
